This project is designed to identify possible Fraudulent activities in Credit Card data using Machine learning. There is pre-processing of data, addressing the problem of class unbalanced and finally classification of the data with a view of identifying wrongful transactions.

The system makes two basic changes to the data, it formats the features to the system standard and applies SMOTE on the data thanks to class imbalance issue. A Random Forest classifier is then fit on processed data. Evaluation of the model is done using accuracy, precision, recall and the F1-score.

This identifies this project as one that makes use of existing theory from the field of machine learning to solve practical problems, in this case, the detection of fraudulent transactions in the financial sector. One more benefit with its utilization is the availability of a good solid framework for constructing and assessing fraudulent models.
